# Portal2D-SDL

Trying to port the Portal2D engine, originally written in 1999 by Derek John Evans, to SDL2.

It's a software-rendered portal-based 2.5D engine. At the moment it compiles successfully for DOS with Open Watcom v2.

I've written and included a Kaitai Struct definitions file for the Portal2D level format. The format itself is pretty barebones, but it should be expandable enough. I might make a new level editor / level format later on down the line if I feel like it.
