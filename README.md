# Portal2D

It's a software-rendered portal-based 2.5D engine, originally written in the summer of 1999 by Derek John Evans.

I've written and included a Kaitai Struct definitions file for the Portal2D level format. The format itself is pretty barebones, but it should be expandable enough. I might make a new level editor / level format later on down the line if I feel like it.
